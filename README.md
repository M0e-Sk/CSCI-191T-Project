# CSCI-191T-Project

Issues may arise when attempting to run the project after initial pull.
To get project to compile and run you may need to edit the project's build properties
to point to the location of the include and lib folders in the common folder on your
computer. The SOIL library may need to be changed as well to use a path that points to
it's location on your computer.
